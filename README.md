# Snake-Game
Description:

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game developed using C++. The game features a basic console-based interface where players control a snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding colloiding with the snake's own body. It's a fun and nostalgic game suitable for beginners looking to explore game development concepts in C++.

Key Features:

Basic console interface for easy gameplay.
Intuitive controls for moving the snake (WASD).
Randomized food placement for dynamic gameplay.
Score tracking to keep track of player progress.
Collision detection to handle game-ending scenarios.
Simple game logic implemented using fundamental C++ concepts.
This project serves as a great learning resource for C++ programming beginners interested in game development. Feel free to explore the source code, experiment with modifications, and enhance the game further according to your preferences and skill level.
